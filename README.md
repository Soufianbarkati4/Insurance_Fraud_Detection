# Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection
ActuarIA SOFTWARE Vehicle Insurance Fraud Detection

*Project Overview :*
This project is dedicated to detecting potential fraud in vehicle insurance claims through data analysis and machine learning. By analyzing patterns and indicators in historical data, this model aims to distinguish between legitimate and potentially fraudulent claims, providing valuable insights for the insurance industry. This project integrates data processing, visualization, and model training to build a robust fraud detection system.

Dataset Analysis: In-depth exploration and analysis of the dataset to understand patterns and identify significant features.
Data Processing: Preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare the data for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Creating and refining features to improve model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluation of models to predict fraudulent claims.

*Project Structure :*
  1. Dataset Analysis
Initial analysis to understand the dataset's structure, distribution, and key variables.
  2. Data Preprocessing
Steps to clean and prepare the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
  3. Feature Engineering
Techniques to create new features or transform existing ones to capture important information relevant to fraud detection.
  4. Modeling
Implementation of machine learning models, such as logistic regression and polynomial regression, to identify fraudulent claims.
Model evaluation with performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to ensure effectiveness.
